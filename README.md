### Hi I'm Ben 👋

#### 🤔 About
- 👨‍💻 I'm intrested in all things web dev, especially Node.js APIs and client-side React SPAs at the moment.
- ❤️ I'm a lover of open source software, looking to start contributing back more.  

#### 🌱 I'm currently exploring...
- [Local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) technolgoies like CRDTs in [Athena](https://github.com/ben-ryder/athena), where I'm building an app for notes, tasks, journalling etc.
- Design systems in [Jigsaw](https://github.com/ben-ryder/jigsaw), which is a design system and component library for use in my other projects.
